            <p>If someone told me that the richest man on Earth (and possibly Mars in the near future of course) stood on 
                a stage celebrating a new president with a strong and deliberate Sieg Heil, I wouldn’t be entirely surprised. 
                Shocked, yes. But surprised? Not at all. And that, in itself, is deeply unsettling, a testament to the times 
                we’re living in. What’s even harder to process isn’t the act, but the reaction. 
                The crowd keeps cheering. There are no shocked faces, no collective gasp, no scandalized silence. 
                Just applause.
                And more confounding still? The aftermath. The consensus among those whose political beliefs align with 
                the president and this hypothetical richest man is, of course, 
                that it wasn’t a Sieg Heil. Obviously, it was a Roman salute. How could we be so naive? How foolish to see 
                reality as it appears when we could reframe it to suit our preferences instead.
                To set the stage (yes, I’m about to quote a dictionary, bear with me), the Cambridge Dictionary defines 
                delusional as “believing things that are not true.” Delusions are a kind of mental gymnastics we perform 
                to maintain beliefs that might not hold up to scrutiny. As a society, we’ve mastered the art of sustaining 
                collective illusions. While classical delusions might isolate an individual, modern delusions, let’s call them 
                their evolved form, bind us together, creating alternate realities we can inhabit, sometimes even multiple at 
                once. This isn’t entirely new. If I indulge my inner philosopher, imagine a cigarette and a 
                faint air of pretension, I’d name-drop Baudrillard and the concept of Post-Truth. 
                The Cambridge Dictionary (yes, again) defines Post-Truth as “the state where arguments grounded 
                in emotions and beliefs are more persuasive than those based on facts”. But rather than delve 
                into Simulacra and Simulation here (you’re welcome), I’ll just hyperlink it. We’re on the internet, 
                after all. you know where to click.
                What’s worth noting is the way delusion has entered our everyday language. 
                Enter Delulu, its cute, abbreviated sibling. By softening its edges, we’ve made delusion 
                almost aspirational. Call someone delulu today, and they likely won’t take offense. Why would they?
                 Delulu is safe, Delulu is comforting, and most importantly Delulu is coping. It’s no longer something to avoid but something 
                 to embrace. After all they say Delulu is the Solulu. 
                So how have we arrived here? How did we find ourselves in this disoriented, fragmented state, 
                where the solution to competing collective delusions seems to be doubling down to the point of
                embracing full-blown hedonism? Perhaps we could call it giga deluluism. Or is it just giga 
                 cognitive dissonance?
